# practical-sparse-portfolio-construction
This project explores how to approximate a dense, continuous-weight portfolio across all S&amp;P 500 stocks with a sparse, practical subset of assets. The approach combines manifold learning and network-based compression to reduce dimensionality while preserving essential portfolio structure.
